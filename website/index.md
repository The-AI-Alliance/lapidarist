## Lapidary

Lapidary is a small library for using LLMs to create
various kinds of indices and data structures used by AI Agents.

One common supported pattern is to extract structured
knowledge from documents, resolve derived entity references,
and load the resulting inforation into a graph database as a
knowledge graph.
